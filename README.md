# ProjHI-LO
Java based Procedual program it's a text based HI-LO game it's really difficult 

Basically as one of my assesments we had to use Java to build a High low guessing game in the procedual programming style
using a text based interface and this is the result. 

I will be planning to update this to an event driven example but that will be whenever I feel like it.
